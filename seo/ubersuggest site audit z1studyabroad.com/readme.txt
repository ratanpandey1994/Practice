1. Problem: Without a H1 heading
Report file: no_h1_heading.csv

2. Problem: Have a low word count
Report file: low_word_count.csv
Description: Without enough text on a page, Google will have trouble understanding what the content is about. 

If Google doesn't know what the content is about, it won't be able to rank your content for the search terms you are targeting. 

By adding more text, you are telling Google's crawlers, and your end users, more about what it is you have to offer. Anything less than a few hundred words is considered thin content and will be nearly impossible to rank.
Solution: Add more content to your page so that it isn't considered thin content and has a better chance of ranking. In general the average web page that ranks on page 1 of Google contains 2200 words.

4. Problem: With no meta description
Report file: no_meta_description.csv
Description: Meta descriptions can significantly increase the chance of someone clicking on your content in the search results. The meta description lets people know what to expect on the page they are about to open. If you choose not to add an optimized and intriguing meta description, the search engine will typically add the first sentence of the page. Usually, that will not be enough to pique the interest of the person searching and they might not click.
Solution: Go through your site content and add relevant and unique meta descriptions to each page to increase your chances of intriguing searchers to click through to your content.
