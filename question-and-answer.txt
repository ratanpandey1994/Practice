My name is Ratan Pandey. I have been working at OG Web Solutions Private Limited for more than 2.5 years, and my total experience in frontend development is over 5 years.

I have worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and jQuery. I have also used various website builders like ClickFunnels (all versions), GoHighLevel, and Webflow. Additionally, I have customized websites in these builders, including automation, courses, and other features.

That's a little about me!

Q. Why do we use "DOCTYPE" in HTML?
A. "DOCTYPE" is used to tell the browser which version of HTML we are using.

Q. What is the use of the <head> tag?
A. The <head> tag stores important information about the webpage, like the title, meta details, styles, and scripts.

Q.What is the difference between the defer and async attributes in JavaScript linking on a webpage?

A.
async loads the script while the page is loading and runs it immediately.
defer loads the script while the page is loading but runs it only after the HTML is fully loaded.

Best Practice: For most websites, defer is recommended because it ensures scripts execute in the correct order without blocking page rendering.

Q. Can I create custom tags like <demo>? If yes, how does the browser handle them? Do they behave like <span> or <div>?
A. Yes, you can create custom tags like <demo>, but browsers don’t give them any special meaning. By default, they behave like inline elements (similar to <span>).

Q. What is the difference between block-level and inline-level elements?

A.

Block-level elements take up the full width and start on a new line (e.g., <div>, <p>, <h1>).
Inline elements take up only the space they need and stay in the same line (e.g., <span>, <a>, <strong>).

In inline-level elements, the top and bottom padding won’t work properly but the content does not move; instead, the height increases, and margins also won’t work as expected.
