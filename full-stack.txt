====================
######**JavaScript**######

-JavaScript improves the user experience of the web page by converting it from a static page into an interative one.
or
JavaScript adds behavior to web page.

######**JavaScript has 8 Datatypes**######
String
Number
Bigint
Boolean
Undefined
Null
Symbol
Object

######**Difference between null vs undefined?**######

`null` and `undefined` are both special values in JavaScript, but they are used in different contexts and have distinct meanings. Here’s a breakdown of their differences:

### 1. **Type**
   - **`undefined`**: It is a type and a value in JavaScript. The type of `undefined` is `"undefined"`.
   - **`null`**: It is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. The type of `null` is `"object"`.

   ```javascript
   console.log(typeof undefined); // "undefined"
   console.log(typeof null); // "object"
   ```

### 2. **Meaning**
   - **`undefined`**: This means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It also represents the default return value of functions that do not explicitly return anything.
   
   ```javascript
   let a;
   console.log(a); // undefined
   
   function myFunction() {}
   console.log(myFunction()); // undefined
   ```

   - **`null`**: This is an assignment value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It’s explicitly set by the programmer to indicate “no value.”

   ```javascript
   let b = null;
   console.log(b); // null
   ```

### 3. **When to Use**
   - **`undefined`**: Typically used by JavaScript itself to indicate the absence of a value. It’s automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but not yet initialized, as well as to function parameters that are not provided with arguments.
   
   - **`null`**: Used by programmers to explicitly indicate that a variable should be empty or have no value. It's often used to reset or clear a variable.

   ```javascript
   let user = { name: "John" };
   user.name = null; // The name is explicitly set to "no value"
   ```

### 4. **Equality**
   - **`undefined == null`**: When using the loose equality operator (`==`), `null` and `undefined` are considered equal because they are both falsy and represent an absence of value.
   
   ```javascript
   console.log(null == undefined); // true
   ```

   - **`undefined === null`**: However, with the strict equality operator (`===`), they are not equal because they are of different types.
   
   ```javascript
   console.log(null === undefined); // false
   ```

### 5. **Common Scenarios**
   - **`undefined`**:
     - Variables declared but not yet assigned a value.
     - Function parameters that are not provided.
     - Missing properties in an object.
     - Accessing an array index that doesn't exist.

   - **`null`**:
     - Explicitly assigned by a developer to indicate that a variable should have no value.
     - Used to reset or clear a value, such as when an object reference is no longer needed.

### 6. **Default Values**
   - **`undefined`**: The default value of a variable that has been declared but not initialized.
   - **`null`**: Not a default value; must be explicitly assigned.

### Summary
- **`undefined`**: Indicates that a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value. It’s used by JavaScript automatically.
- **`null`**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It’s used by developers to explicitly denote that a variable is empty or has no value.

Understanding the difference between `null` and `undefined` is important for writing robust JavaScript code and avoiding common errors related to uninitialized or absent values.


######**What is NaN?**######
*** NaN is property of the global object.
*** In other words, it is a variable in global scope.
*** The initial value of NaN-A-Number.
